This project was created using the book [Building Modern SaaS](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-modern-saas/9781804610879/) as a reference and used AI technologies like ChatGPT, BARD, Claude, and others to build it. So, there might be some bugs here, but I solemnly swear to resolve them. Also, please note that this English text was generated, and mistakes are possible. Just take it.
